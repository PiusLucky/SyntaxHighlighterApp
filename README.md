# SyntaxHighlighterApp
Snippet Highlighter is a web application that converts raw source codes into fancy HTML that can be used directly in your blog or anywhere you intend to drop a quick code snippet. The resultant code is relatively responsive and scalable.

## The Dashboard
<p></p>
![demo](https://github.com/PiusLucky/SyntaxHighlighterApp/blob/master/static/screenshots/page1.PNG?raw=true)
<p></p>
The dashboard displays the input field, stacks, styles and advance options. Each of these categories are extremely useful in outputting a more human-driven 
code snippet. 
<p></p>
## Stack [Languages]
<p></p>

<p></p>
The stack section within the dashboard allows you to choose any programming language of choice, this allows for flexibility over automation. We feature 500+ programming languages as pprovided by the <b>Pygment</b> library. Some of the top languages include <code>Python</code>, <code>Javascript</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>Java</code>, <code>Ruby</code>, <code>Kotlin</code>, Go and so on...

### Styles [Themes]

![demo](https://github.com/PiusLucky/SyntaxHighlighterApp/blob/master/static/screenshots/page1c.PNG?raw=true)

We support 50+ themes including most popular theme like monokai (a default theme for the Sublime text editor)


### Backend
The userface is nothing without a clean and functional backend. The complexities and logic behind the scenes as well as building <code>APIS</code> which are wired with server-side programming languages like Python, NodeJS, ReactJS..

### Algorithms, ML
There has to be a way to get the job done, not just finding the way but also putting effectiveness and efficiency forward. Machine learning algorithms are best for stand-alone actions taken without explicitly instructing the computer to do so.

### Free Projects (+ source code )
We offer majority of our projects for free with all source codes available on github for download. Specifically meant for non-patreons.


### Premium
Premium projects consist of all project materials, source codes, prototypes. Cheapest hosting ideas and domain name purchases for our patreons who also get access to sensitive materials as well as 24/7 support from our dedicated team of software engineers.
